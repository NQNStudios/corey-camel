##Characters##

* Tom Gradgrind (senior) is introduced with a vividly unappealing physical
  description and presented as a strict teacher forcing a rigidly factual
  education on his students. His character arc culminates when he sees
  undeniable proof of the failure of his Utilitarian ideals in Louisa's nervous
  breakdown.
  - "In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether to
    his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general.  In such
    terms, no doubt, substituting the words ‘boys and girls,’ for ‘sir,’ Thomas
    Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers before him,
    who were to be filled so full of facts."
  - "‘Some persons hold,’ he pursued, still hesitating, ‘that there is a wisdom
    of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart.  I have not supposed
    so; but, as I have said, I mistrust myself now.  I have supposed the head
    to be all-sufficient.  It may not be all-sufficient; how can I venture this
    morning to say it is!  If that other kind of wisdom should be what I have
    neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted, Louisa—’"
* Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is a blustery and arrogant member of the
  Coketown elite. He represents the Self-Made Man ideals of many industrialists
  and exists to critique those ideals (as a straw man). He also sees evidence
  of the failure of his ideals, but chooses to ignore it when Stephen begs him
  to consider the plight of the laborers. He is hypocritical in his callous
  response to Stephen's plea for release from marriage, which he later refutes
  by rejecting Louisa, his wife.
  - "The wind began to get boisterous.

    ‘Now, you’ll think this pretty well, Harthouse,’ said Mr. Bounderby.
    ‘You’ll think this tolerably strong.  You’ll say, upon my soul this is
    a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with; but this is nothing,
    sir!  You shall hear me ask this man a question.  Pray, Mr. Blackpool’—wind
    springing up very fast—‘may I take the liberty of asking you how it happens
    that you refused to be in this Combination?’"
  - ‘Now, look you here, Tom Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby the flushed,
    confronting him with his legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his pockets,
    and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was boisterous.  ‘You
    have said your say; I am going to say mine.  I am a Coketown man.  I am
    Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  I know the bricks of this town, and I know
    the works of this town, and I know the chimneys of this town, and I know
    the smoke of this town, and I know the Hands of this town.  I know ’em all
    pretty well.  They’re real.  When a man tells me anything about imaginative
    qualities, I always tell that man, whoever he is, that I know what he
    means.  He means turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, and that he
    wants to be set up with a coach and six.  That’s what your daughter wants.
    Since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants, I recommend
    you to provide it for her.  Because, Tom Gradgrind, she will never have it
    from me.’
* Tom Gradgrind (Junior) is a whelp, an uncontrollable parasite born of
  Gradgrind's system. He exists to demonstrate the use of Utilitarian tactics
  in family relationships, as he pushes Louisa to enter a loveless marriage
  with Bounderby for personal gain.
* Louisa is the most tragic victim of Gradgrind's philosophy. She is taught to
  live a life of repression and sadness, and ends up vulnerable to the
  manipulations of Harthouse.
* Stephen/Rachael are representative of the industrial society's underclass.
  Stephen is imprisoned in a hateful, exploitative marriage with no reprieve or
  even sympathy from Bounderby. Rachael is angelic, and serves to comfort him
  though they cannot be romantically involved.
* Harthouse - a sociopath who exists purely to advance the plot (in spectacular
  fashion) when he seduces Louisa. Appears to have no feelings or identity
* Sissy - representative character of the circus folk. Intuitively sympathetic
  and emotional, she gradually erodes the stiffness in Gradgrind's heart,
  allowing him to see the error in his tragic parenting.
    - Character supported early in then novel through light imagery and
      comparison to Bitzer: "The square finger, moving here and there, lighted
      suddenly on Bitzer, perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of
      sunlight which, darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely
      white-washed room, irradiated Sissy.  For, the boys and girls sat on the
      face of the inclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre
      by a narrow interval; and Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the
      sunny side, came in for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer,
      being at the corner of a row on the other side, a few rows in advance,
      caught the end.  But, whereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired,
      that she seemed to receive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the
      sun, when it shone upon her, the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired
      that the self-same rays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he
      ever possessed.  His cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the
      short ends of lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with
      something paler than themselves, expressed their form.  His short-cropped
      hair might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his
      forehead and face.  His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the
      natural tinge, that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed
      white."
    - Shows her strength of character when confronting Harthouse. No one else
      could touch the place where his heart should have been.

##Setting##

* The unforgettably dreary Coketown. Functions holistically as a microcosm for
  Dickens's vision of Utilitarian society. Uniform buildings, factories, even
  citizens.
* Coal shafts puncture the natural landscape, one of which causes Stephen's
  early demise. The thoughtless industrial capitalism of Bounderby literally
  causes the death of the poor laborer
* The circus plays "foil" to Coketown's lameness. A place of expression and
  entertainment, such as the dancing Gradgrind cannot allow his children to
  enjoy

##Symbols##

* The Hell Shaft - the literally fatal unseen consequences of industrialism
* Mrs. Sparsit's staircase - Sparsit observes Louisa's descent to ruin with
  a certain dose of Schadenfreude. Sad, as Louisa in fact "loses":
    - "Herself again a wife—a mother—lovingly watchful of her children, ever
      careful that they should have a childhood of the mind no less than
      a childhood of the body, as knowing it to be even a more beautiful thing,
      and a possession, any hoarded scrap of which, is a blessing and happiness
      to the wisest?  Did Louisa see this?  Such a thing was never to be."
* Rachael/The Hell Shaft Star - The distant and unattainable salvation from
  titular Hard Times.
    - Rachael is perfect and tender and loves Stephen but they cannot be
      married or live together
    - Stephen watches a star from his place in the Hell Shaft
    
"The bearers being now ready to carry him away, and the surgeon being anxious
for his removal, those who had torches or lanterns, prepared to go in front of
the litter.  Before it was raised, and while they were arranging how to go, he
said to Rachael, looking upward at the star:

‘Often as I coom to myseln, and found it shinin’ on me down there in my
trouble, I thowt it were the star as guided to Our Saviour’s home.  I awmust
think it be the very star!’

They lifted him up, and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to take
him in the direction whither the star seemed to him to lead.

‘Rachael, beloved lass!  Don’t let go my hand.  We may walk toogether t’night,
my dear!’

‘I will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee, Stephen, all the way.’

‘Bless thee!  Will soombody be pleased to coover my face!’

They carried him very gently along the fields, and down the lanes, and over the
wide landscape; Rachael always holding the hand in hers.  Very few whispers
broke the mournful silence.  It was soon a funeral procession.  The star had
shown him where to find the God of the poor; and through humility, and sorrow,
and forgiveness, he had gone to his Redeemer’s rest."

##Allusions##

* The tower of Babel - Coketown's factory chimneys are "competing towers of
  Babel" implying industrial arrogance and inevitable divine punishment. Later
  in his study, Gradgrind watches the chimneys and *wonders if one of them will
  be struck by lightning* in the peak of the novel's subtlety.
* Dickens refers implicitly to regulatory acts of Parliament, and the response
  of industrialists in order to satirize the self-importance and cold disregard
  of factory owners for human life
* Galatians 6:7, "for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." (the
  Volume titles are "Sowing," "Reaping," and "Garnering")
    - possibly refers to many things but most blatantly to Gradgrind's arc of
      bad parenting, then regret when he "sows" the consequences with Tom's
      corruption and Louisa's nervous breakdown.

##Language Use and Style##

* All of it
* Heavy use of simile, metaphor, symbolism, meaningful names and descriptions,
  and other figurative language

##Plot Structure and Narrative Techniques##

* Sowing - Reaping - Garnering
* Essentially a parable, with plot, characters, and setting all in service to
  a didactic message (how Utilitarian)
* As the characters get older Dickens shows more and more of the city. It
  begins in the classroom, then moves to the circus, then the factories and
  unions, etc.

##Point of View##

* 3rd person omniscient with direct preaching from the narrator, Dickens
* Used to deliver the more overt judgments such as "Bounderby = self-made
  humbug" and the final line: "Dear reader!  It rests with you and me,
  whether, in our two fields of action, similar things shall be or not.  Let
  them be!  We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of
  our fires turn gray and cold."

##Archetypes##

* The Wharton-esque Female Intruder: Sissy catalyzes the "feels" around the
  Gradgrind house, upsetting the status quo and revealing the cultural
  inadequacy of Gradgrind's world
* JC: Rachael is pretty chill and stuff

##Major Themes##

* Util bad
  - Stephen's doomed argument with Bounderby
* Live your life
  - "Dear reader!  It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of
    action, similar things shall be or not.  Let them be!  We shall sit with
    lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn gray and
    cold."

* Dickens lays the tragedy on thick. No one gets a happy ending, save Sissy.
  Though proven innocent, Stephen is dead and Rachael in mourning until the
  very end. Tom fails to atone for his crimes against humanity, and never sees
  Louisa again.
  - The pervasive tragedy serves to drive home the central theme: *these things
    are inevitable in the world of Utilitarianism.* "Such things were to be."
* Tom's paragraph is so sad it makes me want to cry.
  - Written with specific language to build distance from Louisa, making the
    reader feel his isolation and hopelessness. "A lonely brother" instead of
    "her lonely brother", "a letter, in a strange hand"
  - "paper blotted with tears," "hope of seeing her," "his last word" all
    somehow rebuild the sympathy Tom loses in earlier chapters
* Sissy is re-christened as the patron of fancy & sole survivor (in the
  strictest sense) of the Hard Times
  - Her kids: She tries hard to "beautify their lives of machinery and reality
    with those imaginative graces and delights..." and in doing so she breaks
    the cycle of unhappiness that doomed her father and the Gradgrinds.
